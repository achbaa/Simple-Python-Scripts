# Tutorial: ChatGPT and Python

## Overview

The purpose of this tutorial is to get you started working between ChatGPT and Python. I recommend starting from a blank script and following the steps within the tutorial.

If you already feel comfortable working in Python or would rather learn on the fly, feel free to move to one of the use case demos.

You can find the tutorial linked [here](https://bcgcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/hoffmann_will_bcg_com/ETkDdeYC28hKviat29a3758B2Eb43EqiWi1zB9gM8keG6A?e=TPjP4m).

## General Tips

As you continue to push your limits, remember:

- **ChatGPT doesn't know everything...**  
  - Even if you're not familiar with the code, share what you can with ChatGPT about the issue you're facing, what you're seeing (screenshots!), and any context you may be able to provide about the data, your desired intent, or the broader project.

- **...ChatGPT does know a lot**  
  - Your goals should be 1. Solve your problem and 2. Spend as little time in Python documentation as possible. When faced with an issue, no matter how big or small, don't be afraid to ask ChatGPT. 

- **Sometimes it is not just copy and paste**  
  - You can save yourself iteration cycles by either looking at whatever code is being passed back to you **or** you can ask ChatGPT to explain what the code is doing in parts and what purpose each part is required for. 
  - Although this may take a little longer in the short-run, doing this when the code is too complex for you to understand can help you avoid future headaches.

- **Break your ask into parts**  
  - ChatGPT can only remember so many things! Try to be as clear and modular as possible with your asks while providing context where necessary.

- **BE PERSISTENT**  
  - ChatGPT considerably lessens the learning curve to code; however, it does not take away the learning entirely. Odds are that your solution and what you want won't be able to be created in one shot (yet). Be patient and keep trying!
